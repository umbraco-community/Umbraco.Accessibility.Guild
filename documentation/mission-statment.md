## What is the Accessibility Guild?

We are a friendly community team working to improve the accessibility of Umbraco in our spare time. We are a community-only team and do not have a steward from Umbraco HQ.

We are always on the lookout for people to help out, so get in touch if you want to get involved.

## Our focus

The latest version of the Umbraco Back Office as supplied in the Umbraco NuGet package.

## Our goals

- Ensure no-one is excluded from using the Umbraco Back Office and to provide an inclusive experience for all (essential for some, useful for all).
- To encourage contributors to submit accessible pull requests.
- Raise awareness of accessibility in the Umbraco community.
- Provide guidance and tooling to make it easy for developers and content creators to create, and difficult to not create, accessible products and services in Umbraco.

## Success criteria

- Umbraco Backoffice meets Web Content Accessibility Guidlines (WCAG) 2.2 Level AA accessibility criteria.
- Umbraco Backoffice meets Authoring Tool Accessibility Guidelines (ATAG) 2.0 accessibility criteria.

## Main activities

- Auditing the Umbraco Backoffice.
- Fixing issues found in the Umbraco Backoffice.
- Raise the profile of accessibility within the Umbraco community.
- Provide a design system, articles, and blogs on how to create accessible products and services in Umbraco.
- Work on tooling which supports the above.

## Current activities

- Conducting an Accessibility audit of the latest version of the Umbraco Backoffice.
- Creating documention to help you make accessible Umbraco websites.
