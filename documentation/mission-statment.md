## What is the Accessibility Guild?

We are a friendly community team working to improve the accessibility of Umbraco in our spare time. We are a community-only team and do not have a steward from Umbraco HQ.

We are always on the lookout for people to help out, so get in touch if you want to get involved.

## Our focus

The latest version of the Umbraco Back Office as supplied in the Umbraco NuGet package.

## Our goals

- Ensure no-one is excluded from using the Umbraco Back Office and to provide an inclusive experience for all (essential for some, useful for all).
- To encourage contributors to submit accessible pull requests.
- Raise awareness of accessibility in the Umbraco community.
- Provide guidance and tooling to make it easy for developers and content creators to create, and difficult to not create, accessible products and services in Umbraco.

## Success criteria

- Umbraco Backoffice meets Web Content Accessibility Guidlines (WCAG) 2.2 Level AA accessibility criteria.
- Umbraco Backoffice meets Authoring Tool Accessibility Guidelines (ATAG) 2.0 accessibility criteria.

## Main activities

- Auditing the Umbraco Backoffice.
- Fixing issues found in the Umbraco Backoffice.
- Raise the profile of accessibility within the Umbraco community.
- Provide a design system, articles, and blogs on how to create accessible products and services in Umbraco.
- Work on tooling which supports the above.

## Current activities

- Conducting an Accessibility audit of the latest version of the Umbraco Backoffice.
- Creating documention to help you make accessible Umbraco websites.

## Communication

You can reach the team directly in the [Umbraco Discord Server](https://discord.gg/umbraco). 

The team commit to attending Umbraco hackathons, time and circumstances allowing including Umbraco Spark, UK Umbraco Festival and Candid Contributions Hackathons.

## Let's meet the team!

**Core Team Members:** Aimee Redmond, Blake Watt, Danny Lancaster, Harry Dance, Jan Skovgaard, Jeremiah Bascue, Jonny Muir, Matt Begent, Mike Masey

## Joining the team

Whilst we do have "core" team members, we don't have a limit to how many people can be involved. If you would like to be involved with the core team, please do get in touch. We tend to have discussions on the [Umbraco Discord Server](https://discord.gg/umbraco) and monthly video calls to catch up and discuses progress and next steps every month or so.

## Terms of agreement

All Community Team members must abide by the [Community Teams Agreement](https://community.umbraco.com/learn-about-the-community/community-teams/community-teams-agreement/).

## How to get involved

There are a number of ways you can get involved with helping the Accessibility Guild, such as;

- Adding Accessibility related issues to the [GitHub issue tracker](https://github.com/umbraco/Umbraco-CMS/issues).
- Creating PR's to help fix known (or unknown) accessibility issues.
- Testing the latest version of Umbraco for issues (When we are able to, we carry out a full accessibility audit of the backoffice too).
- Get involved with discussions around, potentially, features and fixes for accessibility issues.

You can find accessibility-related issues that need attention both in the Accessibility Team Trello Board, and the main Umbraco GitHub issues. The reason there is a separation is because when this project first began, there were too many issues to flood the GitHub issues with, so we need a place that would provide better focus.

As more of the issues are resolved, hopefully, the requirement for a separate Trello board will no longer be required.

### Note

Currently, we are only able to review Umbraco back-office accessibility after it has been released to the public.
